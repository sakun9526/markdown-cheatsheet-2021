## Headings

**Markdown :computer:**

``` markdown

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5 
###### H6


This is also H1
===============

This is also H2
---------------

```

**Output :globe_with_meridians:**

<h1>H1</h1>
<h2>H2</h2>
<h3>H3</h3>
<h4>H4</h4>
<h5>H5</h5>
<h6>H6</h6>

<h1>This is also H1</h1>
<h2>This is also H2</h2>

<br>

Markdown applications donâ€™t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.

| :white_check_mark: Do this      | :negative_squared_cross_mark: Don't do this  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------  |
| # Here's a Heading              | #Here's a Heading                            |
